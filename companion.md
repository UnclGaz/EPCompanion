## 1.0 Introduction

*Eclipse Phase* is a game with an exceptional setting, combining transhumanism, rogue AIs, alien first contact, conspiracies, political conflict, and a post-apocalytic setting, with the potential of even more destruction right on the edge. *Everything* seems to be out get the player-characters specifically, and the rest of transhumanity in general, and yet at the same time the PCs belong to a rag-tag, under-resourced conspiritorial group who might just provide the key to survival. Add this to an rules-system unique yet also familiar, that provides for what is a gear-heavy and diverse enviornment, that is mainly simulationist with a dash of narrativism thrown in, and one has little reason to wonder why *Eclipse Phase* won the 2010 Origins Awards for Best Roleplaying Game, along with three ENnie awards (Gold for Best Writing, Silver for Best Cover Art, Silver for Product of the Year) in the same year.

For this author the setting and the game certainly captured my own interest. I played in two different Eclipse Phase campaigns with completely different groups for quite some time, and then ran my own game for several years. As a result much of the material that is included in this Companion has been extensively playtested, with all sorts of enjoyable levels of horror, despair, and even sometimes elation among the players. I was delighted to engage in playtesting for the second edition of the game, and had the opportunity to interview the designer and author, Rob Boyle, for RPG Review (issue 33, December 2016). 

One of the remarkable things about Eclipse Phase is that it, and all the many and supplements, is that they are released under a Creative Commons license, specifically the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License, including a great deal of the artwork. In a nutshell it means that anyone is free to copy, share, and make use of the text and artwork in the freely distributable PDFs as long as Posthuman Stidios is attributed, it is licensed as a derived work under the same license, and that it is done for non-commercial purposes. The fact that the product is effectively free to consumers as a PDF has not, of course, stopped individuals in the RPG Review Cooperative from going out and purchasing the core rules and various supplements, usually in hardback, as these are quite a work of beauty in their own right. Of course, we also do so to support the artists and designers - and you should to.

The RPG Review Cooperative Inc, is a non-profit incorporated association, registered in the Australian state of Victoria. Our primary objective is the promotion of roleplaying games and to that end our small and merry band help organise conventions (most famously, RuneQuest Glorantha Down Under), have a very extensive games library, publish a 64-page quarterly online 'zine, and a monthly newsletter advertising games, events, member games for sale, and for our budding authors, we bulk purchase ISBNs which we sell at cost. Apart from a cursorary hand-wave to ensure that the publication is actually relevant to the objectives of the organisation and is not going to bring us into disrepute, it is pretty much up to the member themselves what they want to write. To date, we've published "Papers & Paychecks", based on the Willian McLean cartoon in the first edition AD&D Dungeon Masters Guide, which Wizards of the Coast kindly gave us permission to use the title, "The Tinkers Toolkit", a reverse-engineered creature design supplement for D&D 5th edition, and "Cow-Orkers in the Scary Devil Monastery", the first supplement for "Papers & Paychecks". Now, we also have the "Eclipse Phase Companion", as well.

The opportunity is taken here to emphasise our compliance with the license. I openly attribute Posthuman Studios, a thousand times over even, thank you, thank you, thank you for the awesome game. Likewise, the license for this publication is utterly and completely the same as the license that I received from Posthuman Studios; Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License. That's two of the requirements; the third is that the product is for non-commercial purposes. Now this is a bit ticklish, so your author did some extra digging, and this is my understanding from what the Creative Commons FAQ says. The CC's NonCommercial (NC) licenses prohibit uses that are "primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation". Even nonprofit organisations, such as the RPG Review Cooperative, could fall afoul of this and likewise, a for-profit organisation is not prohibited from making use of NC licenses. 

See: https://creativecommons.org/faq/#does-my-use-violate-the-noncommercial-clause-of-the-licenses

The opportunity is taken here to note that this product is not primarily designed for financial compensation (let alone commercial advantage). Certainly, we are selling it as physical copies and even as PDFs, but under the license, we're also giving it away as well. Our primary objective is get the book out and provide people the optional rules, setting information, scenarios and characters. From the Cooperative itself, nobody is making a single cent (red or otherwise) from this publication. If you do give us money, it's covers the costs of printing, in its physical form, and for the modest administrative costs of keeping the organisation running. Our total *turnover* can be measured in a few thousand dollars per annum. Hopefully, that makes it pretty clear where we're coming from and why this publication exists; to  scare the life out of you by postulating a plausible and terrifying future. That's what *Eclipse Phase* is about.

This book consists of three main chapters, of roughly equal length. The first is "Companion Rules", where I've gone through the various rules in Eclipse Phase and its supplements and offer suggestions, simplifications, and elaborations as seen fit and according to playtesting experience. The uniqueness of the game means that isn't *always* intuitive and easy, the gear-heavy nature of the setting sometimes could be streamlined, and yet sometimes the broader setting information is hand-waved a little too easily. At least that was the experience of several GMs and a good score of players that I have discussed this with. 

The second chapter is "Companion Setting", which engages a number of elaborations and alternatives to the official Eclipse Phase setting. For design reasons the *Eclipse Phase* authors did leave a lot quite ambiguous as that both provided both the freedom for GMs to make their own decisions on the setting, and also - or so it seems - to further emphasise the sense of conspiracy among the major players. An opportunity is taken here to fill in some of those gaps in a manner that seems to have the strongest justification by setting logic, or for narrative enjoyment. In addition, places which are very interesting but have more minimal exposure due to publication constraints (e.g., Earth) are elaborated as well.

The final chapter is a number of scenarios and characters that have been involved in our Eclipse Phase campaigns over the years. The scenarios can be loosely coupled, with some plot arcs stretching over several sessions with key characters and items making appearances and re-appearances. 

 
## 2.0 Companion Rules

### Aptitude Maximums

* "Every morph has an aptitude maximum, sometimes modified by traits. This maximum represents the highest value at which the character may use that aptitude while inhabiting that morph, reflecting an inherent limitation in some morphs... Some implants, gear, psi, and other factors may modify a character’s natural aptitudes. These augmented values may exceed a morph's aptitude maximums, as they represent external factors boosting the morph’s ability. No aptitude, however, augmented or not, may ever exceed a value of 40."

* "Hardened Skeleton: The morph's skeleton has been laced with strengthening materials. Apply a +5 DUR and +5 SOM bonus" (p308). 

Ignore the Aptitude Maximum rule. If you get over 40 from your morph plus machines, good for you!

### Insurance


- Backup insurance is for egos (p269) as an infomorph. 
- Morphs can be rented at a cost of 1% per day (p278) which includes rental insurance. The rental insurance policy is designed to reduce risk of damage to the morph (no illegal activities, cannot be taken anywhere too dangerous, or lawless). Insurance covers only 80% of the morph's cost.

Proposed new rule: Morph insurance depend on how much you want to insure it for and the risk involved. Normal insurance is 2% of the value insured per month. Low risk insurance is 1% of the value insured, and high risk insurance is 3% per month of the value insured. Very high risk (e.g., combat, lawless areas etc) typically is not available.

### Time Dilation in VR

"Time itself is an adjustable constant in VR, though deviation from true time has its limits. So far, transhuman designers have achieved time dilation up to 60 times faster or slower than real time (roughly one minute equaling either one hour or one second). Time slowdown is far more commonly used, granting more time for simulspace recreational activities (more time, more fun!), learning, or work (economically effective). Time acceleration, on the other hand, is extremely useful for making long distance travel through space more tolerable." p241.

A player in my game today argued that they be able to put their ego (and forks) in a simulspace VR environment and engage in a programming task 60 times faster than in real space, per ego and fork.

Note that this is a maximum speedup that has been achieved; a Eclipse Phase era supercomputer.

That seemed to be too much a rules exploit to me. To me it seemed more like VR could provide an experience of +/- 60x rather than actual provision of mental tasks at that rate.

However see this for an excellent elaboration why it doesn't happen.
http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/34741/why-is-time-dilated-simulspace-not-an-i-win-button

Essentially the 60x speedup would require at least 60 computers that can handle the memory for a ego/fork and the high speed interconnect. Given that most personal computing systems can handle one extra ego (cyberbrain/ghhostrider module) is is not unreasonable to suggest that additional minds requires increasing power (cf., MPI programming communication issues)

"Cybernetic brains are where the ego (or controlling AI) resides in synthmorphs and pods. Modeled on
biological brains, cyberbrains have a holistic architecture and serve as the command node and central processing point for sensory input and decision-making. Only one ego or AI may “inhabit” a cyberbrain at a time; to accommodate extras, mesh inserts (p. 300) or a ghostrider module (p. 307) must be used."

So I'd interpret that as being that a Ghostrider module is an habitation for a Cyberbrain.

Which also provides a bit of an answer to the time dilation question. To treat it roughly, it would take about sixty of these to provide the equivalent of a 60x speedup (a slowdown, of course, is a lot easier, just put in `sleep` statements in your code). There is also a network complexity issue as the number increases etc.

Basically, by using the same processing power as a cyberbrain/module you could achieve one 2x speedup.


### Negative and Bonus Rez Points

The standard rules for Eclipse Phase provides Rez Points if "The character achieved a motivational goal" (p384). Motivational goals are defined (p120) as abstract ideals of concrete goals, and may be expressed as being in favour (+) or opposed to (-) the specific motivation.

On occassion however the course of an adventure may result in the radical opposite of their motivation. A character may have a motivational goal as being opposed to becoming famous (i.e., -Fame). In such situations there is some justifiction according to the game's logic, to apply a negative Rez Point.

However, following this logic further, a character who does not participate in an adventure should receive -1 Rez Point, if they dramatically fail their objectives they should receive -1 Rez Point, or if the player engaged in poor behaviour they should receive -1 Rez Point and so forth.

All of a sudden however, characters could find themselves receiving significantly less Res Points which is notable for a game that already starts characters at a very high ability but has quite slow and incremental gains after that. An argument can be made to extend bonus Rez Points slightly to make up for these negative Rez Points. Thus the following is offered as an alternative rule:

Every character should be awarded Rez Point for each of the following criteria that is met:

* The character participated in each session (-1 to +1).
* The character achieved the objectives in that scenario (-1 to +1).
* The character learned a valuable lesson from the scenario (-1 to +1).
* The character contributed to achieving success in a signiﬁcant way (+1 for each major contribution).
* The character contributed to mission failure in a significant way (-1 for each major contribution).
* The scenario was particularly simple or challenging (-1 to +1).
* The character achieved or failed at a motivational goal (-1 to +1 for each goal).
* The player engaged in good roleplaying in the session (-1 to +1).
* The player significantly contributed to the session's drama, humor, or fun with roleplaying (-1 to +1).

Different egos count as 5+ separation.

### Sensors in Space

A basic reality in space is that with the right sensors you can detect objects from a very long distance. Whilst there is much to be said for the visual excitement of space combat that looks like something out of a Star Wars or Star Trek film, a more realistic example would be "Ship A detects Ship B at well-beyond transhuman visual range and destroys it". 

There are two broad categories of sensor from the user's point of view; active and passive. Active sensors are like a flashlight - they're pretty good at illuminating the object of the illumination, and they're also pretty good at illuminating the subject who is using the flashlight. Passive sensors are like most types of normal perception; sight is passive, hearing is passive etc. The subject using the sensor doesn't send out a beacon that they're searching for something. Heat sensors are passive; telescopes are passive. Something that sends out a ping to to detect an object and then works it out from the return is active, such as radar, sonar, and lidar.

Use of active sensors is very useful, but it illuminates the subject. This leads to a game of "wild weasel" as the US air-force has coined it. The following is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Weasel">our friends at Wikipedia</a>, and beautifully illustrated the game the follows:

```
In brief, the task of a Wild Weasel aircraft is to bait enemy anti-aircraft defenses into targeting it with their radars, whereupon the radar waves are traced back to their source, allowing the Weasel or its teammates to precisely target it for destruction. A simple analogy is playing the game of "flashlight tag" in the dark; a flashlight is usually the only reliable means of identifying someone in order to "tag" (destroy) them, but the light immediately renders the bearer able to be identified and attacked as well. The result is a hectic game of cat-and-mouse in which the radar "flashlights" are rapidly cycled on and off in an attempt to identify and kill the target before the target is able to home in on the emitted radar "light" and destroy the site. 
```

Passive sensors are very effective in space as well. Spacecraft tend to generate heat; and any infra-red radiation can be detected. Pinpointing the location becomes a lot easier with multiple detectors and triangulation.

The general principles for sensors is space is to test for as many frequencies as possible across the spectrum (radar, radiation, infrared) and the capacity to detect is subject to an inverse square law; i.e., 1/r^2 for passive sensors and 1/r^4 for active sensors - and active sensors take twice as long to receive the data. The system has to "ping" and receive the return information. The effective (engineering) cost for passive sensors is an eight-times cost for a doubling of range. But detecting first is everything, right?

One usual method for tricking sensors is to create decoys. This doesn't work terribly well for spacecraft as the size and momentum has to correlate to trick the sensor, which can be very expensive if you want to create a decoy of a Destroyer, for example. You would need something that is the size and mass of 2,000-tons that creates the signature of anti-matter drive. A static decoy is far less expensive; it just needs to be about the right size.

For more glorious detail on this subject see: "Detection" on Project Rho (http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/spacewardetect.php). The following is an illustrative comment:

```
As of 2013, the Voyager 1 space probe is about 18 billion kilometers away from Terra and its radio signal is a pathetic 20 watts (or about as dim as the light bulb in your refrigerator). But as faint as it is, the Green Bank telescope can pick it out from the background noise in one second flat.
```
### Surya

Surya movement has also been raised. Normally, when the physics of motion is applied there is a force acting against a mass. This remains true for a Case walking on Luna, a Bouncer on Locus, or even a Cloud Skate on a gas giant. But what about the Surya? We are told they "surf the solar wind" (p99 Morph Recognition Guide) but the winds only blow outwards. Taking a technique from sailing, Surya can move (slowly) against the solar winds by tacking. By applying their fins in one direction then they other in a zig-zag motion, they can travel at 1/4 of their normal pace against the wind.

In addition, Surya also have reaction mass, which can bring this movement up to 1/2. Rather like how massive blue whales subsist on microscopic plankton, Surya gain energy from eating microscopic plasma from the sun's atmosphere. Obviously their internal organs have been very well-designed to manage this.
