Chapter 1: Eclipse Phase Rules
==============================

Aptitude Maximums
-----------------
* "Every morph has an aptitude maximum, sometimes modified by traits. This maximum represents the highest value at which the character may use that aptitude while inhabiting that morph, reflecting an inherent limitation in some morphs... Some implants, gear, psi, and other factors may modify a character’s natural aptitudes. These augmented values may exceed a morph's aptitude maximums, as they represent external factors boosting the morph’s ability. No aptitude, however, augmented or not, may ever exceed a value of 40."

* "Hardened Skeleton: The morph's skeleton has been laced with strengthening materials. Apply a +5 DUR and +5 SOM bonus" (p308). 

Ignore the Aptitude Maximum rule. If you get over 40 from your morph plus machines, good for you!

Insurance
---------

- Backup insurance is for egos (p269) as an infomorph. 
- Morphs can be rented at a cost of 1% per day (p278) which includes rental insurance. The rental insurance policy is designed to reduce risk of damage to the morph (no illegal activities, cannot be taken anywhere too dangerous, or lawless). Insurance covers only 80% of the morph's cost.

Proposed new rule: Morph insurance depend on how much you want to insure it for and the risk involved. Normal insurance is 2% of the value insured per month. Low risk insurance is 1% of the value insured, and high risk insurance is 3% per month of the value insured. Very high risk (e.g., combat, lawless areas etc) typically is not available.

Time Dilation in VR
-------------------

"Time itself is an adjustable constant in VR, though deviation from true time has its limits. So far, transhuman designers have achieved time dilation up to 60 times faster or slower than real time (roughly one minute equaling either one hour or one second). Time slowdown is far more commonly used, granting more time for simulspace recreational activities (more time, more fun!), learning, or work (economically effective). Time acceleration, on the other hand, is extremely useful for making long distance travel through space more tolerable." p241.

A player in my game today argued that they be able to put their ego (and forks) in a simulspace VR environment and engage in a programming task 60 times faster than in real space, per ego and fork.

Note that this is a maximum speedup that has been achieved; a Eclipse Phase era supercomputer.

That seemed to be too much a rules exploit to me. To me it seemed more like VR could provide an experience of +/- 60x rather than actual provision of mental tasks at that rate.

However see this for an excellent elaboration why it doesn't happen.
http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/34741/why-is-time-dilated-simulspace-not-an-i-win-button

Essentially the 60x speedup would require at least 60 computers that can handle the memory for a ego/fork and the high speed interconnect. Given that most personal computing systems can handle one extra ego (cyberbrain/ghhostrider module) is is not unreasonable to suggest that additional minds requires increasing power (cf., MPI programming communication issues)

"Cybernetic brains are where the ego (or controlling AI) resides in synthmorphs and pods. Modeled on
biological brains, cyberbrains have a holistic architecture and serve as the command node and central processing point for sensory input and decision-making. Only one ego or AI may “inhabit” a cyberbrain at a time; to accommodate extras, mesh inserts (p. 300) or a ghostrider module (p. 307) must be used."

So I'd interpret that as being that a Ghostrider rmodule is an habitation for a Cyberbrain.

Which also provides a bit of an answer to the time dilation question. To treat it roughly, it would take about sixty of these to provide the equivalent of a 60x speedup (a slowdown, of course, is a lot easier, just put in `sleep` statements in your code). There is also a network complexity issue as the number increases etc.

Basically, by using the same processing power as a cyberbrain/module you could achieve one 2x speedup.


Negative and Bonus Rez Points
-----------------------------

The standard rules for Eclipse Phase provides Rez Points if "The character achieved a motivational goal" (p384). Motivational goals are defined (p120) as abstract ideals of concrete goals, and may be expressed as being in favour (+) or opposed to (-) the specific motivation.

On occassion however the course of an adventure may result in the radical opposite of their motivation. A character may have a motivational goal as being opposed to becoming famous (i.e., -Fame). In such situations there is some justifiction according to the game's logic, to apply a negative Rez Point.

However, following this logic further, a character who does not participate in an adventure should receive -1 Rez Point, if they dramatically fail their objectives they should receive -1 Rez Point, or if the player engaged in poor behaviour they should receive -1 Rez Point and so forth.

All of a sudden however, characters could find themselves receiving significantly less Res Points which is notable for a game that already starts characters at a very high ability but has quite slow and incremental gains after that. An argument can be made to extend bonus Rez Points slightly to make up for these negative Rez Points. Thus the following is offered as an alternative rule:

Every character should be awarded Rez Point for each of the following criteria that is met:

* The character participated in each session (-1 to +1).
* The character achieved the objectives in that scenario (-1 to +1).
* The character learned a valuable lesson from the scenario (-1 to +1).
* The character contributed to achieving success in a signiﬁcant way (+1 for each major contribution).
* The character contributed to mission failure in a significant way (-1 for each major contribution).
* The scenario was particularly simple or challenging (-1 to +1).
* The character achieved or failed at a motivational goal (-1 to +1 for each goal).
* The player engaged in good roleplaying in the session (-1 to +1).
* The player significantly contributed to the session's drama, humor, or fun with roleplaying (-1 to +1).
